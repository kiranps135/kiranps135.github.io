# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Kiran Sonawane ...ðŸ˜Š  
### **A Cloud & DevOps Engineer From India**

**Cloud & DevOps Engineer | Cloud Enthusiast | Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)**

I graduated from **Pune University** with a Bachelor's degree in **Information Technology**, earning excellent and honors grades in **2017**. Presently, I am working as a **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** in a private cloud or data center provider company. I have expertise in automating, optimizing, and managing end-to-end software development and deployment pipelines using **CI/CD**, infrastructure automation, and scalable solutions.

I am a super nerd who loves Linux and containerization, and I enjoy customizing all development environments. I am interested in devising better problem-solving methods for challenging tasks and learning new tools and technologies.

In addition to Kubernetes, I have a strong background in containerization with Docker and automating workflows with CI/CD pipelines. I also focus heavily on monitoring and logging to provide real-time insights and ensure smooth operations.

In my free time, I love spending time with my friends, family, and exploring new places.
